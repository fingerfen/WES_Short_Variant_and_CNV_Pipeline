This is a cohort study done on congenital heart defects (CHD) in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome patients. The goal of the project is to find mutations that are overrepresented in the cases group vs the controls group. There were 380 total samples used for this study and after filtration, only 147 cases (22q11.2 DS patients with CHD) and 134 controls (22q11.2 DS patients without CHD) remains. Gene-gene, GO term, and MP term analyses were all and the results displayed below.
